# Code Review

Code review written by [DavisDavisDavis](https://github.com/DavisDavisDavis).

1. `update.php` - A lot of the '$statment->execute()' are repeated. Instead by using 'if' statements to check what 'post items' have been set, it is possible to only update the column that are in use ('isset'). E.g 

   'if (isset($_POST['title'])) {
      $statement->bindParam(':title', $_POST['title'], PDO::PARAM_STR);
    }'
    
2. `index.php:8` - Some issues with 'successMsg' It will give an error each time it's called. 📝

'Warning: Undefined variable $successMsg in /Users/macbook/Documents/GitHub/useless_website/Wunderlist-1/index.php on line 8
You are now logged out.'

3. `wunderlist.php` - A lot of divs could be replaces with html sematics or completely removed and combined into a single div; however I'm not familiar with bootstrap which might be the explanation for the amount of divs.

4. `wunderlistold.sqlite` - Just an old database. 📀🐱

5. `functions.js:5-9` - The functions that does't use 'return' could be set with the 'void' type declaration

6. `wunderlist.js` - All of the constants and comments at the beginning are a bit overwhelming 😵‍💫 and could either be split up into different files or the constants could be set above the respective functions that they will be used for. 

7. `account.php:64-65` - SVG could be saved in it's own file and saved in the images folder

8. `updateaccount.php:10-15` - As of now it is possible to upload pictures of any size as an avatar which probably should have a limit. 📸

9. `wunderlist` - All of the file names are in lowercase and for readability it would be better to use cammelCase or snake_case.

10. `wunderlist.php` - It is possible to get an error code inside of the task description... 

'Deprecated: htmlspecialchars(): Passing null to parameter #1 ($string) of type string is deprecated in /Users/macbook/Documents/GitHub/useless_website/Wunderlist-1/wunderlists.php on line 357'
